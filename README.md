Work in progress

# Features to add

* Show a popup with a map when clicking on a name
* Show distance to each item
* Calculate time-to-reach and decide if it will be closing by the ETA
* Lock items to make sure they're always in the list (even if far away)
* Define radius of search
* Cache results to avoid strain on overpass-turbo (needed?)
